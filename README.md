# ModernSiteBuilder
A simple javascript plugin to create a website in less than a minute! Currently only supports text sections, but later I will add more features to it.

## READ THIS BEFORE USING
This plugin will most likely return an error if you enable <code>useParticles</code>. Disable it if it's causing problems, it is because of your browser.
### FIXES
#### Firefox
Go to <code>about:config</code> and search <code>security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy</code>. Disable that and it should be fixed.
#### Chrome
It's harder to disable that for Chrome, since it doesn't have a built-in config URL. I don't use Chrome, so I don't know how to fix that for Chrome, but I will try to find a fix. For now, there's no working fix that I know.
