# ModernSiteBuilder
A simple javascript plugin to create a website in less than a minute! Currently only supports text sections, but later I will add more features to it.

<span style="color:red">## READ THIS BEFORE USING</span>
This plugin will most likely return an error if you enable `useParticles`. Disable it if it's causing problems, it is because of your browser.
## FIXES
### Firefox
Go to `about:config` and search `security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy`. Disable that and it should be fixed.
### Chrome
It's harder to disable that for Chrome, since it doesn't have a built-in config URL. I don't use Chrome, so I don't know how to fix that for Chrome, but I will try to find a fix. For now, there's no working fix that I know.

The only way to fix that for browsers other than Firefox, you need to publish your website to Github and publish it to Github Sites.
